# pr-spam-guard

pr-spam-guard is a smart gitHub bot that automatically detects and labels low effort, bot generated, or suspicious pull requests so maintainers can focus on real contributions.

#### Features
- Uses AI to flag bot generated, suspicious PRs so maintainers donâ€™t have to sift through noise.
- Never auto closes or blocks PRs. Only labels and explains you stay in full control.
- Every flagged PR gets a comment explaining why it was flagged helping new contributors learn and reducing confusion.
- Contributors can comment ```/not-spam``` to instantly remove the label and mark themselves as trusted.
- PRs from past contributors or team members are fast-tracked no delays, no labels.
- Customize rules using ```.spamguard.yml``` set sensitivity, trusted users, or disable checks.

ðŸ’– Contributions, feedback are always welcome.
